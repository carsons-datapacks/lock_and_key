### Locking
Shift right-click on a block with a trial key to lock it.

The key will be given a unique ID (like maps).

Locked blocks can't be interacted with or broken.

### Unlocking
Right-click with the correct key to unlock a block.

### Key Cloning
Use a *Bolt Armor Trim*, a *Trial Key*, and a *Copper Ingot* to clone a key in a smithing table.

The cloned key will work anywhere the original key does.

### Lost Keys
If you lose a key, you will have to break back into any locked blocks.

For example, TNT can be used to blast your way into these blocks.
